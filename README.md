# 💻 About the project 
The project revolves around a Luxury Car Reservation platform, offering users a seamless and user-friendly experience to explore the fleet, select desired vehicles for reservation, and finalize their bookings.

# ⏫ Some features worth highlighting

- Car Filtering: We've implemented a search functionality that allows users to filter cars by brand, year, and color. This makes it easy to find the desired car according to their preferences.
- Integration with Stripe API: To provide a secure and convenient payment method, we've integrated the Stripe API. Now, users can make payments for their chosen car directly through the platform, using reliable payment methods.
- Enhanced User Experience: Our focus has been on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface. This ensures that users can navigate the platform effortlessly, view detailed car information, and complete their reservations without complications.

# ⏫ Some future features

- User Login and Registration System: We plan to implement a robust user login and registration system. This will allow users to create personalized accounts, access their individual control panel, and easily track their past and current reservations.
- Real-time Notifications: We intend to implement real-time notifications to keep users informed about new available cars, special offers, and important updates related to their reservations.
